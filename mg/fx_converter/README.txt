README

Aim: outputs the exchange rate from one currency to another by finding out the conversion path with the greatest exchange value. Market changes are mimicked using a random walk and updated

Files:
-Currency.cpp: outlines the currency names and identifiers
-ExchangeBoard.cpp: finds out the greatest currency conversion
-ExchangeRate.cpp: creates a nested unordered map containing information to access the exchange rates
-main.cpp: main file where users input is received and sent to the required methods for conversion
-RandomWalk.cpp: calculates a change in the bid and quotes mimicking that of the market
-UnitTest.cpp: unit tests for the functions, 
-Updater.cpp: function required to update the unordered map containing exchange rates
